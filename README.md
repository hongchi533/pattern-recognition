several machine learning  models for Spam and CMU-PIE dataset classification

1. Spam classification
This code implemented classifiers for Spam classification using four methods: Beta-Binomial Naïve Bayes, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression with L2 regularization and K-Nearest Neighbors. Error rate is used as metric of model performance evaluation and ploted in order.

2. CMU-PIE classification
This project implemented several algorithms: PCA/LDA/SVM/GMM/CNN, on dataset combined with CMU PIE dataset and 10 selfies. Model performance are visualized.
